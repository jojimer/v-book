Today, I will<\/p><p>tell you about the difference between the synthetic<\/p><p>replacement treatment of thyroid irregularity and<\/p><p>natural replacement treatment.<\/p><p>The difference between Euthyrox (Levothyroxine) and<\/p><p>Armour (dried animal thyroid powder), of which it is<\/p><p>widely spoken today.<\/p><p>A new insight into medicine! From the beginning! The<\/p><p>goal of alternative hormone treatment is to correct the<\/p><p>irregular thyroid function. If your thyroid hormone<\/p><p>drops, it is similar to that if somebody undercut the floor<\/p><p>under your feet.<\/p><p>Symptoms come slowly. Depression, fatigue, lack of<\/p><p>energy, etc. (increased cholesterol!) ...<\/p><p>Thyroid hormone is a metabolic hormone, the hormone<\/p><p>that regulates other hormones is the thermostat of your<\/p><p>body ... that is, we must constantly have a sufficient<\/p><p>amount of thyroid hormone in the blood.<\/p><p>There are two thyroid hormones in the body. T4<\/p><p>(thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). We monitor<\/p><p>thyroid activity by measuring TSH. Your goal is to get<\/p><p>your TSH to the upper normal limit between 2.5 and 3.0<\/p><p>thyroid points.<\/p><p>If your TSH is elevated and you have problems that are<\/p><p>related to the thyroid, it is prudent to talk to your doctor<\/p><p>to edit and adjust the therapy. So the dose is increased.<\/p><p>If your thyroid hormone is not regulated, then it is<\/p><p>difficult to care for your health in a different way.<\/p><p>Similar as in depression. If you see the world through<\/p><p>black-and-gray glasses, it is hard to think about how well<\/p><p>you do your homework, the next exam, be positive on<\/p><p>coffee with your friends, or go to the hills to get some<\/p><p>fresh air.<\/p><p>The thyroid hormone is so important! Unfortunately, the<\/p><p>we do not know how to or cannot treat decreased<\/p><p>thyroid function (hypothyroidism, Hashimoto) causally.<\/p><p>Thyroid tissue (follicles in it) breaks down and there is no<\/p><p>more hormone (we may be able to treat thyroid failure in<\/p><p>the future with stem cell transplantation). So we need to<\/p><p>start to replace the thyroid hormone.<\/p><p>A little before, I mentioned that there are two ways of<\/p><p>replacing thyroid hormone. Synthetic thyroid hormone<\/p><p>(levothyroxine, Euthyrox) and natural thyroid hormone<\/p><p>(Armour). Today, this is most often dried pig thyroid<\/p><p>extract. Sometimes it was also a cow's thyroid.<\/p><p>It all started in 1891, when a gentleman with the name<\/p><p>Murray first discovered that hypothyroidism can be<\/p><p>treated with an extract of thyroid. And so the treatment<\/p><p>of decreased thyroid function started.<\/p><p>If you take a pig thyroid or a cow thyroid, grind it and<\/p><p>turn it into powder, it will contain different substances. It<\/p><p>will contain T4 thyroid hormone and T3 thyroid<\/p><p>hormone and some other inactive substances.<\/p><p>The first difference between synthetic hormone and the<\/p><p>natural one is therefore that natural one contains T3<\/p><p>thyroid hormone as well (which is not necessarily good<\/p><p>because it can cause an increased amount of this<\/p><p>hormone in the blood).<\/p><p>Treatment with a \u201cnatural\u201d preparation (this is not<\/p><p>exactly salad, that is why the quotation marks) continued<\/p><p>until 1960, when synthetic thyroid hormone<\/p><p>(levothyroxine) was discovered, and it slowly began to<\/p><p>replace the natural one.<\/p><p>Why? There are quite a few reasons. Firstly. When<\/p><p>preparing natural thyroid replacement hormone<\/p><p>preparations (eg. Armour), you cannot accurately know<\/p><p>how much of the T4 and T3 hormone a certain part of<\/p><p>the tissue contains.<\/p><p>This means that if you take this medication today, you<\/p><p>will get a certain amount of hormone, and if you take it<\/p><p>tomorrow, you will get a different amount of hormone<\/p><p>(1).<\/p><p>If the target TSH values for treating thyroid dysfunction<\/p><p>at the upper limit are between 2.5 and 3.0 thyroid<\/p><p>points, this means that this level of hormone is very<\/p><p>difficult to maintain in the blood. And it is important<\/p><p>that you keep your TSH at this level!<\/p><p>The second problem is that many more cases of overdose<\/p><p>appear. There are cases when you have an excessive<\/p><p>amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, which is,<\/p><p>again, not good. The lower limit of TSH in the blood is<\/p><p>0.5 thyroid points.<\/p><p>It is also not good if TSH suppression occurs. This<\/p><p>happens, for example, in the increased functioning of the<\/p><p>thyroid, in Graves' disease (we call the symptoms a<\/p><p>thyroid storm because it actually is a storm).<\/p><p>Strong heartbeat, weakness, confusion, weight loss,<\/p><p>restlessness, increased appetite, etc. But the long-term<\/p><p>effects are mainly problematic. In the long run, an<\/p><p>increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood leads<\/p><p>to osteoporosis and heart problems. For this reason, most<\/p><p>endocrinologists do not want to hear about \u201cnatural\u201d<\/p><p>thyroid hormones.<\/p><p>Another scientific discovery that has led to the use of a<\/p><p>synthetic thyroid hormone that you can take today if you<\/p><p>have thyroid problems is that most T3 hormones<\/p><p>originate from the T4 hormone after leaving your<\/p><p>thyroid gland. So T3 hormone is not that important.<\/p><p>It is important for the functioning of the body \u2013 it is<\/p><p>stronger than the T4 hormone! However, the body can<\/p><p>produce it itself from T4 hormone (from thyroxine \u2013<\/p><p>thyroid hormone).<\/p><p>In order to replace the thyroid hormone, it is enough to<\/p><p>enter the T4 hormone into the body \u2013 that is,<\/p><p>levothyroxine or Euthyrox.<\/p><p>They have also found that both forms of treatment are<\/p><p>approximately equally effective, but in the long run,<\/p><p>treatment with synthetic hormones is much easier to<\/p><p>control (osteoporosis, heart problems). And so natural<\/p><p>treatment of decreased thyroid function slowly went into<\/p><p>oblivion \u2013 until today's boom, caused by bad media<\/p><p>information.<\/p><p>If you have a thyroid problem, TAKE SYNTHETIC<\/p><p>THYROID HORMONE. Do not listen to the nonsense<\/p><p>about the \u201cnatural\u201d thyroid treatment. The role of<\/p><p>alternative hormonal treatment is precisely what<\/p><p>\u201calternative\u201d means. Replacing hormones. And nothing<\/p><p>more.<\/p><p>You have to have normal thyroid hormones so that you<\/p><p>can focus on things that are really important for your<\/p><p>health. Healthy lifestyle. Healthy food! Medications are a<\/p><p>support and nothing more.<\/p><p>Taking natural hormones can be considered for people<\/p><p>who have problems with synthetic hormone. But these<\/p><p>are very few. If you have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto),<\/p><p>decreased thyroid function:<\/p><p>- Follow your doctor's instructions for taking thyroid<\/p><p>replacement hormone.<\/p><p>- If you have elevated TSH, and symptoms of thyroid<\/p><p>dysfunction: fatigue, depression, sensitivity to cold, body<\/p><p>weight gain, constipation, strong menstruation, hoarse<\/p><p>voice, forgetfulness, muscle pain), you must contact your<\/p><p>doctor to optimize your therapy. The upper normal limit<\/p><p>of TSH is between 2.5 and 3.0.<\/p><p>Because you may not be depressed or tired for the last<\/p><p>month due to problems with your husband or wife, but<\/p><p>also because of your thyroid!<\/p><p>Thyroid hormone absorption is best on an empty<\/p><p>stomach (in the morning before breakfast) and worse<\/p><p>along with fibre-rich food (healthy nutrition!).<\/p><p>Lastly, do not worry over it. Long-term health depends<\/p><p>on your lifestyle.
