Today, I will tell you about the difference between the synthetic replacement treatment of thyroid irregularity and natural replacement treatment.<\/p><p>The difference between Euthyrox (Levothyroxine) and Armour (dried animal thyroid powder), of which it is widely spoken today.<\/p><p>A new insight into medicine! From the beginning! The goal of alternative hormone treatment is to correct the irregular thyroid function. If your thyroid hormone drops, it is similar to that if somebody undercut the floor under your feet.<\/p><p>Symptoms come slowly. Depression, fatigue, lack of energy, etc. (increased cholesterol!) ...<\/p><p>Thyroid hormone is a metabolic hormone, the hormone that regulates other hormones is the thermostat of your body ... that is, we must constantly have a sufficient amount of thyroid hormone in the blood.<\/p><p>There are two thyroid hormones in the body. T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). We monitor thyroid activity by measuring TSH. Your goal is to get your TSH to the upper normal limit between 2.5 and 3.0 thyroid points.<\/p><p>If your TSH is elevated and you have problems that are related to the thyroid, it is prudent to talk to your doctor to edit and adjust the therapy. So the dose is increased.<\/p><p>If your thyroid hormone is not regulated, then it is difficult to care for your health in a different way.<\/p><p>Similar as in depression. If you see the world through black-and-gray glasses, it is hard to think about how well you do your homework, the next exam, be positive on coffee with your friends, or go to the hills to get some fresh air.<\/p><p>The thyroid hormone is so important! Unfortunately, the we do not know how to or cannot treat decreased thyroid function (hypothyroidism, Hashimoto) causally.<\/p><p>Thyroid tissue (follicles in it) breaks down and there is no more hormone (we may be able to treat thyroid failure in the future with stem cell transplantation). So we need to start to replace the thyroid hormone.<\/p><p>A little before, I mentioned that there are two ways of replacing thyroid hormone. Synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine, Euthyrox) and natural thyroid hormone (Armour). Today, this is most often dried pig thyroid extract. Sometimes it was also a cow's thyroid.<\/p><p>It all started in 1891, when a gentleman with the name Murray first discovered that hypothyroidism can be treated with an extract of thyroid. And so the treatment of decreased thyroid function started.<\/p><p>If you take a pig thyroid or a cow thyroid, grind it and turn it into powder, it will contain different substances. It will contain T4 thyroid hormone and T3 thyroid hormone and some other inactive substances.<\/p><p>The first difference between synthetic hormone and the natural one is therefore that natural one contains T3 thyroid hormone as well (which is not necessarily good because it can cause an increased amount of this hormone in the blood).<\/p><p>Treatment with a \u201cnatural\u201d preparation (this is not exactly salad, that is why the quotation marks) continued until 1960, when synthetic thyroid hormone (levothyroxine) was discovered, and it slowly began to replace the natural one.<\/p><p>Why? There are quite a few reasons. Firstly. When preparing natural thyroid replacement hormone preparations (eg. Armour), you cannot accurately know how much of the T4 and T3 hormone a certain part of the tissue contains.<\/p><p>This means that if you take this medication today, you will get a certain amount of hormone, and if you take it tomorrow, you will get a different amount of hormone (1).<\/p><p>If the target TSH values for treating thyroid dysfunction at the upper limit are between 2.5 and 3.0 thyroid points, this means that this level of hormone is very difficult to maintain in the blood. And it is important that you keep your TSH at this level!<\/p><p>The second problem is that many more cases of overdose appear. There are cases when you have an excessive amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, which is, again, not good. The lower limit of TSH in the blood is 0.5 thyroid points.<\/p><p>It is also not good if TSH suppression occurs. This happens, for example, in the increased functioning of the thyroid, in Graves' disease (we call the symptoms a thyroid storm because it actually is a storm).<\/p><p>Strong heartbeat, weakness, confusion, weight loss, restlessness, increased appetite, etc. But the long-term effects are mainly problematic. In the long run, an increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood leads to osteoporosis and heart problems. For this reason, most endocrinologists do not want to hear about \u201cnatural\u201d thyroid hormones.<\/p><p>Another scientific discovery that has led to the use of a synthetic thyroid hormone that you can take today if you have thyroid problems is that most T3 hormones originate from the T4 hormone after leaving your thyroid gland. So T3 hormone is not that important.<\/p><p>It is important for the functioning of the body \u2013 it is stronger than the T4 hormone! However, the body can produce it itself from T4 hormone (from thyroxine \u2013 thyroid hormone).<\/p><p>In order to replace the thyroid hormone, it is enough to enter the T4 hormone into the body \u2013 that is, levothyroxine or Euthyrox.<\/p><p>They have also found that both forms of treatment are approximately equally effective, but in the long run, treatment with synthetic hormones is much easier to control (osteoporosis, heart problems). And so natural treatment of decreased thyroid function slowly went into oblivion \u2013 until today's boom, caused by bad media information.<\/p><p>If you have a thyroid problem, TAKE SYNTHETIC THYROID HORMONE<strong>.<\/strong> Do not listen to the nonsense about the \u201cnatural\u201d thyroid treatment. The role of alternative hormonal treatment is precisely what \u201calternative\u201d means. Replacing hormones. And nothing more.<\/p><p>You have to have normal thyroid hormones so that you can focus on things that are really important for your health. Healthy lifestyle. Healthy food! Medications are a support and nothing more.<\/p><p>Taking natural hormones can be considered for people who have problems with synthetic hormone. But these are very few. If you have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto), decreased thyroid function:<\/p><p>- Follow your doctor's instructions for taking thyroid replacement hormone.<\/p><p>- If you have elevated TSH, and symptoms of thyroid dysfunction: fatigue, depression, sensitivity to cold, body weight gain, constipation, strong menstruation, hoarse voice, forgetfulness, muscle pain), you must contact your doctor to optimize your therapy. The upper normal limit of TSH is between 2.5 and 3.0.<\/p><p>Because you may not be depressed or tired for the last month due to problems with your husband or wife, but also because of your thyroid!<\/p><p>Thyroid hormone absorption is best on an empty stomach (in the morning before breakfast) and worse along with fibre-rich food (healthy nutrition!).<\/p><p>Lastly, do not worry over it. Long-term health depends &nbsp;on your lifestyle.

Your head aches, your voice is hoarse and it is difficult for you to concentrate? One of the possible causes of these problems is insufficient thyroid function.<\/p><p>The thyroid gland is one of the most important glands with internal secretion. It is twined around our trachea, right below the Adam\u2019s apple.<\/p><p>Its task is to excrete thyroid hormones that are indispensable for the growth, development and proper functioning of our organs.<\/p><p>In addition, it plays an important role in regulating the level of calcium in the body. In the literature, it is possible to read that the thyroid produces ONE TEASPOON OF HORMONES within one year.<\/p><p>So, it is a real hormone factory. However, when it excretes too few thyroid hormones, we talk about insufficient thyroid function. Expertly, this is called hypothyroidism.<\/p><p>The causes of hypothyroidism may be several. The most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The disease was named after its discoverer, a Japanese doctor, Hakaru Hashimoto. Thyroiditis means inflammation of the thyroid gland. It is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis or autoimmune thyroiditis.<\/p><p>Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease. What does that mean? It means that your own immune system recognizes your thyroid as a foreign object.<\/p><p>It starts to treat the thyroid as a virus or a bacterium that harms us and needs to be destroyed. To this end, it begins to produce antibodies directed against the thyroid. The consequence is damage and inflammation of the thyroid. All this slowly leads to a state where our thyroid is no longer able to produce enough thyroid hormones.<\/p><p>For now, we cannot yet fully explain why our own defence system attacks the thyroid. The disease usually progresses slowly and may be recognized late.<\/p><p>At the beginning, the disease does not usually cause problems, and in this period it is often detected coincidentally.<\/p><p>Eventually, however, as the disease progresses and the lack of thyroid hormones goes worse, it is shown in a very varied way.<\/p><p>You can have a headache, you feel tired, sleepy, depressed, or you unexpectedly gain weight, your digestion is decelerated, your voice is hoarse, you notice various changes on your skin, etc.<\/p><p>But when do we think of hypothyroidism and Hashimoto's thyroiditis? The disease is often difficult to recognize due to numerous problems and gradual deterioration.<\/p><p>Many of these problems are often attributed to stress because of today's way of life, because of aging, or because of another illness.<\/p><p>We should certainly think of insufficient thyroid function when the above problems are present. You should go to your personal doctor for unexplained, long-lasting fatigue, if you have dry skin, pale and blurred face or if you are constipated.<\/p><p>A suspected disease will be confirmed or denied by a personal doctor with a simple blood test to determine the values of the appropriate hormones and antibodies.<\/p><p>However, for a more detailed examination of the thyroid and an accurate diagnosis, treatment with a specialist \u2013 endocrinologist \u2013 is necessary.<\/p><p>Based on investigations, a thyroid doctor decides what kind of treatment to apply. Treatment includes replacement of thyroid hormone in the form of tablets.<\/p><p>This way, we replace the thyroid hormone deficiency due to insufficient thyroid function. Regular blood controls are required during treatment.<\/p><p>Without treatment, symptoms and signs may increase. Thyroid enlargement can occur \u2013 so-called goitre. This way, thyroid tries to replace hormone production which is too low.<\/p><p>Do we have any influence on the course of the disease? The course of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis is difficult to influence.<\/p><p>With a healthy lifestyle, we can alleviate the problems that the disease causes and contribute to the better functioning of our immune system.

In England, a research showed that 6.6% of men have some or all thyroid problems. The second study showed that thyroid is giving problems to as much as 12.3% of people with type 2 diabetes. In diabetes, thyroid diseases occur more often, and vice versa.<\/p><p>Thyroid is a gland, like pancreas. It is located at the front of the neck and it releases hormones into the blood that affect many of the functions in our body. Among other, they accelerate growth, development of nervous system and functioning of metabolism and heart.<\/p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means that the body itself attacks pancreas cells, causing an insulin deficit. The most common cause of underactive thyroid function is the body attacks it itself and either destroys it or prevents the production of its hormones.<\/p><p>Therefore, the connection between type 1 diabetes and malfunction of the thyroid is not unusual.<\/p><p>It is somewhat more difficult to explain the link between thyroid problems and type 2 diabetes. The latter is more common and appears most often in adults who live an unhealthy lifestyle. Eating high-caloric food, bad food (so-called \u201cjunk food\u201d) and sedentary lifestyle have led to the true epidemic of diabetes.<\/p><p>The link between the two illnesses is related to atherosclerosis, increased pressure, and associated cardiovascular diseases, which are more frequent in diabetics.
