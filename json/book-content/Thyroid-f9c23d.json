did not discover anything, <\/span><span> but he <\/span><span> found something extraordinary about thyroid. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> In rabbits that were closed for longer time in the lab <\/span><span> cages, <\/span><span> thyroid swelling often developed. <\/span><span> To put it simply, <\/span><span> <\/span><span> thyroid activity decreased. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Dr. Chesney was not able to link the effect with syphilis. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> With captured rabbits, <\/span><span> the thyroid increased 20 times. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> The colloid in which the thyroid hormones are formed <\/span><span> was slowly disappearing and immune cells were <\/span><span> accumulated in it. <\/span><span> Metabolism in infected rabbits, <\/span><span>

dedicated to a 7-day thyroid menu <\/span><span> that you can test and see how it affects your well-being <\/span><span> and thyroid hormones. <\/span><span> For now, <\/span><span> nutrition science in <\/span><span> thyroid glands remains in laboratories. <\/span><span> One of the <\/span><span> reasons for this is that the science of health is still in the <\/span><span> background of the

medicine for today's illness . <\/span><span>. <\/span><span>. <\/span><span> one of the reasons is also to <\/span><span> bring clarity to today's medical confusion. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> What you hear on the Internet, <\/span><span> on television, <\/span><span> and <\/span><span> reading in magazines is really confusing! Today, <\/span><span> I will <\/span><span> tell you about the difference between the synthetic <\/span><span> replacement treatment of thyroid irregularity and <\/span><span> natural replacement treatment. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> The difference between Euthyrox (Levothyroxine) and <\/span><span> Armour (dried animal thyroid powder), <\/span><span> of which it is <\/span><span> widely spoken today. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> A new insight into medicine! From the beginning! The <\/span><span> goal of alternative hormone treatment is to correct the <\/span><span> irregular thyroid function. <\/span><span> If your thyroid hormone <\/span><span> drops, <\/span><span> it is similar to that if somebody undercut the floor <\/span><span> under your feet. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Symptoms come slowly. <\/span><span> Depression, <\/span><span> fatigue, <\/span><span> lack of <\/span><span> energy, <\/span><span> etc. <\/span><span> (increased cholesterol!) . <\/span><span>. <\/span><span>. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Thyroid hormone is a metabolic hormone, <\/span><span> the hormone <\/span><span> that regulates other hormones is the thermostat of your <\/span><span> body . <\/span><span>. <\/span><span>. <\/span><span> that is, <\/span><span> we must constantly have a sufficient <\/span><span> amount of thyroid hormone in the blood. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> There are two thyroid hormones in the body. <\/span><span> T4 <\/span><span> (thyroxine) and T3 (triiodothyronine). <\/span><span> We monitor <\/span><span> thyroid activity by measuring TSH. <\/span><span> Your goal is to get <\/span><span> your TSH to the upper normal limit between 2. <\/span><span>5 and 3. <\/span><span>0 <\/span><span> thyroid points. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> If your TSH is elevated and you have problems that are <\/span><span> related to the thyroid, <\/span><span> it is prudent to talk to your doctor <\/span><span> to edit and adjust the therapy. <\/span><span> So the dose is increased. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> If your thyroid hormone is not regulated, <\/span><span> then it is <\/span><span> difficult to care for your health in a different way. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Similar as in depression. <\/span><span> If you see the world through <\/span><span> black-and-gray glasses, <\/span><span> it is hard to think about how well <\/span><span> you do your homework, <\/span><span> the next exam, <\/span><span> be positive on <\/span><span> coffee with your friends, <\/span><span> or go to the hills to get some <\/span><span> fresh air. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> The thyroid hormone is so important! Unfortunately, <\/span><span> the <\/span><span> we do not know how to or cannot treat decreased <\/span><span> thyroid function (hypothyroidism, <\/span><span> Hashimoto) causally. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Thyroid tissue (follicles in it) breaks down and there is no <\/span><span> more hormone (we may be able to treat thyroid failure in <\/span><span> the future with stem cell transplantation). <\/span><span> So we need to <\/span><span> start to replace the thyroid hormone. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> A little before, <\/span><span> I mentioned that there are two ways of <\/span><span> replacing thyroid hormone. <\/span><span> Synthetic thyroid hormone <\/span><span> (levothyroxine, <\/span><span> Euthyrox) and natural thyroid hormone <\/span><span> (Armour). <\/span><span> Today, <\/span><span> this is most often dried pig thyroid <\/span><span> extract. <\/span><span> Sometimes it was also a cow's thyroid. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> It all started in 1891, <\/span><span> when a gentleman with the name <\/span><span> Murray first discovered that hypothyroidism can be <\/span><span> treated with an extract of thyroid. <\/span><span> And so the treatment <\/span><span> of decreased thyroid function started. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> If you take a pig thyroid or a cow thyroid, <\/span><span> grind it and <\/span><span> turn it into powder, <\/span><span> it will contain different substances. <\/span><span> It <\/span><span> will contain T4 thyroid hormone and T3 thyroid <\/span><span> hormone and some other inactive substances. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> The first difference between synthetic hormone and the <\/span><span> natural one is therefore that natural one contains T3 <\/span><span> thyroid hormone as well (which is not necessarily good <\/span><span> because it can cause an increased amount of this <\/span><span> hormone in the blood). <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Treatment with a \u201cnatural\u201d preparation (this is not <\/span><span> exactly salad, <\/span><span> that is why the quotation marks) continued <\/span><span> until 1960, <\/span><span> when synthetic thyroid hormone <\/span><span> (levothyroxine) was discovered, <\/span><span> and it slowly began to <\/span><span> replace the natural one. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Why? There are quite a few reasons. <\/span><span> Firstly. <\/span><span> When <\/span><span> preparing natural thyroid replacement hormone <\/span><span> preparations (eg. <\/span><span> Armour), <\/span><span> you cannot accurately know <\/span><span> how much of the T4 and T3 hormone a certain part of <\/span><span> the tissue contains. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> This means that if you take this medication today, <\/span><span> you <\/span><span> will get a certain amount of hormone, <\/span><span> and if you take it <\/span><span> tomorrow, <\/span><span> you will get a different amount of hormone <\/span><span> (1). <\/span><span> <\/span><span> If the target TSH values for treating thyroid dysfunction <\/span><span> at the upper limit are between 2. <\/span><span>5 and 3. <\/span><span>0 thyroid <\/span><span> points, <\/span><span> this means that this level of hormone is very <\/span><span> difficult to maintain in the blood. <\/span><span> And it is important <\/span><span> that you keep your TSH at this level! <\/span><span> The second problem is that many more cases of overdose <\/span><span> appear. <\/span><span> There are cases when you have an excessive <\/span><span> amount of thyroid hormone in the blood, <\/span><span> which is, <\/span><span> <\/span><span> again, <\/span><span> not good. <\/span><span> The lower limit of TSH in the blood is <\/span><span> 0. <\/span><span>5 thyroid points. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> It is also not good if TSH suppression occurs. <\/span><span> This <\/span><span> happens, <\/span><span> for example, <\/span><span> in the increased functioning of the <\/span><span> thyroid, <\/span><span> in Graves' disease (we call the symptoms a <\/span><span> thyroid storm because it actually is a storm). <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Strong heartbeat, <\/span><span> weakness, <\/span><span> confusion, <\/span><span> weight loss, <\/span><span> <\/span><span> restlessness, <\/span><span> increased appetite, <\/span><span> etc. <\/span><span> But the long-term <\/span><span> effects are mainly problematic. <\/span><span> In the long run, <\/span><span> an <\/span><span> increased amount of thyroid hormone in the blood leads <\/span><span> to osteoporosis and heart problems. <\/span><span> For this reason, <\/span><span> most <\/span><span> endocrinologists do not want to hear about \u201cnatural\u201d <\/span><span> thyroid hormones. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Another scientific discovery that has led to the use of a <\/span><span> synthetic thyroid hormone that you can take today if you <\/span><span> have thyroid problems is that most T3 hormones <\/span><span> originate from the T4 hormone after leaving your <\/span><span> thyroid gland. <\/span><span> So T3 hormone is not that important. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> It is important for the functioning of the body \u2013 it is <\/span><span> stronger than the T4 hormone! However, <\/span><span> the body can <\/span><span> produce it itself from T4 hormone (from thyroxine \u2013 <\/span><span> thyroid hormone). <\/span><span> <\/span><span> In order to replace the thyroid hormone, <\/span><span> it is enough to <\/span><span> enter the T4 hormone into the body \u2013 that is, <\/span><span> <\/span><span> levothyroxine or Euthyrox. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> They have also found that both forms of treatment are <\/span><span> approximately equally effective, <\/span><span> but in the long run, <\/span><span> <\/span><span> treatment with synthetic hormones is much easier to <\/span><span> control (osteoporosis, <\/span><span> heart problems). <\/span><span> And so natural <\/span><span> treatment of decreased thyroid function slowly went into <\/span><span> oblivion \u2013 until today's boom, <\/span><span> caused by bad media <\/span><span> information. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> If you have a thyroid problem, <\/span><span> TAKE SYNTHETIC <\/span><span> THYROID HORMONE. <\/span><span> Do not listen to the nonsense <\/span><span> about the \u201cnatural\u201d thyroid treatment. <\/span><span> The role of <\/span><span> alternative hormonal treatment is precisely what <\/span><span> \u201calternative\u201d means. <\/span><span> Replacing hormones. <\/span><span> And nothing <\/span><span> more. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> You have to have normal thyroid hormones so that you <\/span><span> can focus on things that are really important for your <\/span><span> health. <\/span><span> Healthy lifestyle. <\/span><span> Healthy food! Medications are a <\/span><span> support and nothing more. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Taking natural hormones can be considered for people <\/span><span> who have problems with synthetic hormone. <\/span><span> But these <\/span><span> are very few. <\/span><span> If you have hypothyroidism (Hashimoto), <\/span><span> <\/span><span> decreased thyroid function: <\/span><span> <\/span><span> - Follow your doctor's instructions for taking thyroid <\/span><span> replacement hormone. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> - If you have elevated TSH, <\/span><span> and symptoms of thyroid <\/span><span> dysfunction: <\/span><span> fatigue, <\/span><span> depression, <\/span><span> sensitivity to cold, <\/span><span> body <\/span><span> weight gain, <\/span><span> constipation, <\/span><span> strong menstruation, <\/span><span> hoarse <\/span><span> voice, <\/span><span> forgetfulness, <\/span><span> muscle pain), <\/span><span> you must contact your <\/span><span> doctor to optimize your therapy. <\/span><span> The upper normal limit <\/span><span> of TSH is between 2. <\/span><span>5 and 3. <\/span><span>0. <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Because you may not be depressed or tired for the last <\/span><span> month due to problems with your husband or wife, <\/span><span> but <\/span><span> also because of your thyroid! <\/span><span> Thyroid hormone absorption is best on an empty <\/span><span> stomach (in the morning before breakfast) and worse <\/span><span> along with fibre-rich food (healthy nutrition!). <\/span><span> <\/span><span> Lastly, <\/span><span> do not worry over it. <\/span><span> Long-term health depends <\/span><span> on your lifestyle. <\/span><span> On devoting 15 minutes per day to <\/span><span> exercise and consuming healthy nutrition! <\/span><span> ------------------------------ <\/span><span> <i>Discovery: <\/span><span><\/i> <\/span><h4>The connection between diabetes and thyroid: <\/span><span><\/h4><span> <i>Elevated insulin level that circulates through the blood stimulates<\/i> <\/span><span> <i>thyroid growth and reduces the level of thyroid hormone (1; <\/span><span> 2). <\/span><span><\/i> <\/span><span> <i>Normal insulin level, <\/span><span> on an empty stomach: <\/span><span><\/i> <\/span><span> <i>&lt; <\/span><span> 25 insulin points (mIU\/l)<\/i> <\/span><span> <i>&lt; <\/span><span> 174 insulin points (pmol\/l)<\/i> <\/span>"},{"chapter":"1","bg":"","cpart":"Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (decreased thyroid function)","sound":"3","align":"center","content":"<p>Are you tired, sleepy, apathetic, and depressed?

It means that your own immune system<\/p><p>recognizes your thyroid as a foreign object.<\/p><p>It starts to treat the thyroid as a virus or a bacterium that<\/p><p>harms us and needs to be destroyed. To this end, it<\/p><p>begins to produce antibodies directed against the<\/p><p>thyroid. The consequence is damage and inflammation<\/p><p>of the thyroid. All this slowly leads to a state where our<\/p><p>thyroid is no longer able to produce enough thyroid<\/p><p>hormones.<\/p><p>For now, we cannot yet fully explain why our own<\/p><p>defence system attacks the thyroid.

As<\/p><p>if it was yesterday I remember the first school day, when<\/p><p>I noticed that she was carrying an unusual device around<\/p><p>her waist, which I had not seen before.<\/p><p>When we got to know each other better, she said that she<\/p><p>had had type 1 diabetes since childhood. The device on<\/p><p>her waist was nothing but an insulin pump, which<\/p><p>constantly measured blood sugar and provided insulin if<\/p><p>necessary.<\/p><p>As much as possible, the device imitated a defective<\/p><p>pancreas, which had already been attacked and<\/p><p>destroyed by my friend\u2019s antibodies. Although it has<\/p><p>been many years since then, we have stayed in touch.<\/p><p>Recently, she confided in me with the finding of her<\/p><p>doctor that her thyroid does not function properly.<\/p><p>Last year, a study was carried out in the Netherlands<\/p><p>which showed that in children with type 1 diabetes<\/p><p>associated thyroid problems are 24 times more likely to<\/p><p>develop. These include both the under-functioning<\/p><p>thyroid, called hypothyroidism, as well as excessivelyfunctioning<\/p><p>thyroid action, which is called<\/p><p>hyperthyroidism.<\/p><p>Unfortunately, type 2 diabetes is also associated with<\/p><p>thyroid problems. In England, a research showed that<\/p><p>6.6% of men have some or all thyroid problems. The<\/p><p>second study showed that thyroid is giving problems to<\/p><p>as much as 12.3% of people with type 2 diabetes. In<\/p><p>diabetes, thyroid diseases occur more often, and vice<\/p><p>versa.<\/p><p>Thyroid is a gland, like pancreas. It is located at the front<\/p><p>of the neck and it releases hormones into the blood that<\/p><p>affect many of the functions in our body. Among other,<\/p><p>they accelerate growth, development of nervous system<\/p><p>and functioning of metabolism and heart.<\/p><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. This means<\/p><p>that the body itself attacks pancreas cells, causing an<\/p><p>insulin deficit. The most common cause of underactive<\/p><p>thyroid function is the body attacks it itself and either<\/p><p>destroys it or prevents the production of its hormones.<\/p><p>Therefore, the connection between type 1 diabetes and<\/p><p>malfunction of the thyroid is not unusual.<\/p><p>It is somewhat more difficult to explain the link between<\/p><p>thyroid problems and type 2 diabetes. The latter is more<\/p><p>common and appears most often in adults who live an<\/p><p>unhealthy lifestyle. Eating high-caloric food, bad food<\/p><p>(so-called \u201cjunk food\u201d) and sedentary lifestyle have led to<\/p><p>the true epidemic of diabetes.<\/p><p>The link between the two illnesses is related to<\/p><p>atherosclerosis, increased pressure, and associated<\/p><p>cardiovascular diseases, which are more frequent in<\/p><p>diabetics. It is certainly necessary to add genes, which,<\/p><p>unfortunately, we cannot influence, to create a perfect<\/p><p>cocktail.<\/p><p>But, you know what gamblers say \u2013 bad cards do not<\/p><p>mean the end of the game. It is important to withstand<\/p><p>all factors that stimulate the onset of diabetes!<\/p><p>You have the final say in this. Just make sure it does not<\/p><p>stay in words only...<\/p><p>A healthy and nutritious meal, which contains as few<\/p><p>sugars as possible and is rich in fibre, should be at your<\/p><p>table every day.

If you are<\/p><p>thinking to start \u2013 do not start.<\/p><p>Also, try to stay as little as possible in an environment<\/p><p>where there is a lot of cigarette smoke.
