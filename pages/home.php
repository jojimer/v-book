    <h1 class="text-monospace text-center p-5 mb-0 mt-5"> How to use the editor? <small class="d-block h6">The editor allows you to create books that have a combination of text, images, animations, videos and sound which makes it unique and you can take advantage of this.
    <p></p>
    Animations are arts where a lot of drawn images are put together to create a computer animation. If you want to do this in a professional way we suggest you collaborate on a project together with an artist or an animator, this way your book will offer the highest value. Same goes with sound effects that you can place on any page.If you are an animator, then we suggest collaboration with a writer. Fiverr.com is a good way to find collaborators quickly and for a reasonable price. For top notch content you need to get a professional artist and do a collaboration with him.
    <p></p>
    If you are content with hobby animations and sound effects that you will be adding into your book, then you can use one of the royalty free websites where you can find images, videos, animations and sound effects royalty free. Always credit the authors. We list some of the royalty free websites for content at the end of the page.

     - Word editor contains tools to edit text, you can add a gif animation or video in between text. If you are adding video you can embed it currently (from Youtube for example).<p></p>
     - Choosing an image background is done from the editor box on the right side of word editor. You can simply add a color background to your text, or you can add an image or gif animation.<p></p>
     - Choosing a sound effect for the chapter is done below the background image editor. You can upload sound effect in mp3 form. You can set after how many seconds after the reader turns the page, the sound effect is triggered.<p></p>
